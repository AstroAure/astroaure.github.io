Ahoy 👋

I'm **Aurélien Genin**, a french 🇫🇷 master student passionate about space engineering 🛰️ and astronomy 🔭. 

I'm currently enrolled in the robotics master at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/robotics/) 🇨🇭, where I also follow courses in space engineering. I've previously been studying engineering at [École polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) 🇫🇷 and observational astronomy at [Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur](https://www.oca.eu/fr/duao-oca) 🇫🇷. You can learn more about my studies on the [Education](https://astroaure.github.io/education) page. In the near future, I would love to develop small (or big) robots roaming on other worlds 🤖🪐 ! For now, I gaze at the universe through the eyes of the robots I wish to one day build and fly/drive, and through my telescope, with which I've been [APOD 19/01/2024](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240119.html) 🌟

During my studies, I've worked on many different [projects](https://astroaure.github.io/projects), ranging from robotics (development of a tracked robot with flipper arms at [Exail](https://www.exail.com/) 🇫🇷) to astronomy (morphological study of over 300k galaxies at high redshifts at the [Cosmic DAWN Center](https://cosmicdawn.dk/) 🇩🇰 and observation and analysis of the tri-colour light-curve of asteroid (6) Hebe at [OCA](https://www.oca.eu/fr/duao-oca) 🇫🇷), but also in science communication, or various coding projects.
