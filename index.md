Ahoy 👋

I'm **Aurélien Genin**, a french 🇫🇷 master student passionate about space engineering 🛰️ and astronomy 🔭. 

I'm currently stuyding engineering at [École polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) 🇫🇷 and observational astronomy at [Observatoire de Côte d'Azur](https://www.oca.eu/fr/duao-oca) 🇫🇷 and will soon begin a robotics master at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/robotics/) 🇨🇭. In the near future, I would love to develop small (or big) robots roaming on other worlds 🤖🪐 ! For now, I gaze at the universe through the eyes of the robots I wish to one day build and fly/drive, and through my telescope, with which I've been [APOD 19/01/2024](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap240119.html) 🌟

For the next few months, as a trainee, I'm working at the [Cosmic DAWN Center](https://cosmicdawn.dk/) 🇩🇰 on implementing SourceXtractor++ to perform model fitting and morphology measurements for galaxies on the JWST public images available through the [DAWN JWST Archive](https://dawn-cph.github.io/dja/).
